# AI Audio Assessment System

A backend API that allows you to upload an audio answer and a question, and receive a detailed AI-powered evaluation using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini. The system provides comprehensive feedback including analysis, scoring, and improvement suggestions in structured JSON format.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **AI Evaluation**: Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligent assessment
- ðŸ“Š **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive feedback with scoring and suggestions
- âš¡ **Simple API**: Upload audio and question, get JSON feedback

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key and any other settings:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     PORT=3000
     NODE_ENV=development
     MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
     UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
     ```
4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   For development with auto-restart:

  }
}
```

## Scoring System
- **content**: out of 5
- **clarity**: out of 5
- **completeness**: out of 5
- **total**: out of 15 (sum of the three above)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: Maximum audio file size in bytes (default: 10MB)
- `UPLOAD_PATH`: Directory for temporary audio files (default: ./uploads)

### OpenAI API Requirements

- Requires a valid OpenAI API key
- Uses GPT-4o-mini model for evaluation
- Audio files are automatically cleaned up after processing

## Troubleshooting

1. **OpenAI API Error**
   - Verify your API key is correct in `.env`
   - Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
   - Ensure the API key has access to GPT-4o-mini

2. **Audio Upload Issues**
   - Ensure you are uploading a valid audio file (mp3, wav, etc.)
   - Check file size is under the configured limit

3. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check if port 3000 is already in use
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check the `.env` file is properly configured
